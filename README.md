# C - tic tac toe Game

I created a tic tac toe game with C, that allows two players to play against each other.
Allowing the player to choose the grid size up to 50 x 50. 
Players can choose to drop their O / X via typing in their coordinates to regarding the x and y.
There are check functions that check the grid for winners, such as checking vertically, horizontally, and diagonally.
When the game ends, in terminal, it will announce a winner.
